## Thought Process
The primary goal was to create a scalable and interactive visualization tool. Key design choices include:

- React for minimal and good frontend.
- Plotly.js for rich data visualization with easy integration with React.
- Users can take help of AI to get summary of dataset and ask queries.
- Gemini for generating responses of user's queries.


## Technologies Used

- React
- Python
- Plotly
- HTML & CSS
- NodeJS
- Gemini API

## Future Improvements

- Add more graphs and plots with diverse visualization techniques
- Integrate other datasets
